# Teacher Names Setup Guide

## 🔒 **Private Teacher Names Configuration**

The teacher names are now stored securely in environment variables and are not visible in the public code.

## 🚀 **Setting Up Teacher Names in Railway**

### **Step 1: Go to Railway Dashboard**
1. **Navigate to your project** in Railway
2. **Click on your service** (mitosis-game)
3. **Go to "Variables" tab**

### **Step 2: Add Environment Variable**
1. **Click "New Variable"**
2. **Variable Name**: `PREDEFINED_TEACHERS`
3. **Variable Value**: `Darius,Petree,Bolden,Wastani,Simmons,Steiner,Askew`
4. **Click "Add"**

### **Step 3: Redeploy**
Railway will automatically redeploy your application with the new environment variable.

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### **In Production (Railway):**
- ✅ **Teacher names** are loaded from environment variables
- ✅ **Names are private** and not in the public code
- ✅ **Fuzzy matching** works with the real teacher names
- ✅ **Case insensitive** matching still works

### **In Development:**
- ✅ **Fallback names** are used if environment variable is not set
- ✅ **Local development** works without Railway
- ✅ **No sensitive data** in the codebase

## 🎯 **Benefits**

- ✅ **Security**: Teacher names are not in public repository
- ✅ **Flexibility**: Easy to add/remove teachers without code changes
- ✅ **Privacy**: Sensitive information stays private
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Update teachers through Railway dashboard

## 🔄 **Adding/Removing Teachers**

To update the teacher list:
1. **Go to Railway Variables**
2. **Edit the `PREDEFINED_TEACHERS` variable**
3. **Update the comma-separated list**
4. **Save changes** (Railway will redeploy automatically)
